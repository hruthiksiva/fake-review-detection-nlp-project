## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Fake reviews can be detrimental to businesses and consumers alike. This project leverages NLP techniques to develop a fake review detection system. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `nlppreprocess`
- `nltk`

## Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
The project begins by loading the necessary libraries and loading the dataset from an external source. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and format conversion.

## Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>
Text preprocessing is a critical step in NLP. The project performs the following:
- Removing HTML tags
- Removing punctuations and numbers
- Expanding contractions
- Removing stopwords, lemmatization, etc.

Feature extraction is done using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. The "Verified Purchase" column is also added as a feature.

## Model Building <a name="model-building"></a>
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is chosen for this task. The model is trained using the preprocessed data and evaluated for accuracy.

## Model Persistence <a name="model-persistence"></a>
The trained SVM model is saved to a file using the `pickle` library. This allows the model to be used later without retraining.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Fake review detection is crucial for maintaining the credibility of online reviews. This project demonstrates how NLP techniques and machine learning can be employed to build an effective fake review detection system.

## Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>
- Experiment with different classifiers and feature engineering techniques.
- Explore more advanced NLP models such as deep learning architectures.
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time fake review detection.
